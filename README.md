This repository contains some of the blueprints I’ve created in Dyson Sphere Program.

Unlike [my similar repository for Factorio blueprints](https://github.com/lexi-lambda/factorio-blueprints), the blueprints in this repository are exclusively stored as encoded blueprint strings, for two reasons:

1. The DSP blueprint format is more complicated than the Factorio format. [A library exists that claims to handle them](https://github.com/johndoe31415/dspbptk), but packaging it didn’t seem worth the effort.

2. I am simply much less invested in DSP than I am in Factorio.

This unfortunately makes the diffs completely useless: the files in this repository might as well be binaries. However, they are at least fairly small, and the ability to access historical versions is still useful.
